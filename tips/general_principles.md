## General Principles

1. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other elements.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should only have one reason to change.
3. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Use named constants instead of hard-coded values.
4. **Keep Functions Small**: A function should do one thing, and do it well.
5. **Comment Code Sparingly**: Write code that is self-explanatory; avoid unnecessary comments.
